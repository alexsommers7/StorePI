Because of this, the calorie count is also completely inaccurate. I've tried adjusting the fit of the watch as well as where it rests on my wrist and none of this has made it more accurate.",

I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking to update your old one. You smiply cannot beat this quality at this price! Highly recommended!",

I bought this because I really like the smell of the original flowerbomb but it's one of my besties signature scents so I think of her whenever I smell it. I thought this would be similar but still have it's own identity but it sadly does not. It is basically the original flowerbomb with vanilla.",
