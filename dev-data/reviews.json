    "review": "Amazing, clear, and good price. I've been shopping around for a decent-sized monitor for quite a while now. There are literally thousands to choose from, but I was working on a budget. This monitor came in to save the day. The box it comes in is really professional and neatly packed, it sets up really easily too. I do not regret the purchase at all.",

I love the vanilla orchid vibe I'm getting from this and it's beautiful. Overall this is a nice balance of floral and sweet (but not full on gourmand) and I really like that. I think this is a versatile scent and great for layering as well.",
