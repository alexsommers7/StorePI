I bought the watch mainly for tracking workouts and to upgrade from my old fitbit but its essentially useless as it frequently is off by 60+bpm for my HR and will say I'm 'relaxing' when my HR is really 160. Because of this, the calorie count is also completely inaccurate. I've tried adjusting the fit of the watch as well as where it rests on my wrist and none of this has made it more accurate.",

I am also loving the spotlight on the camera. I almost overlooked it at first, but it is so bright that it lights up my driveway beautifully at night! There's also a scheduling function that I use to turn the light on automatically from 8pm to 11:30pm. Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a home security camera.

The one next to it is much brighter even though I lowered the dimming. The colors are nice and when used separately they are a great buy when on sale. You get a remote for each but you can save those and only use one on all of them. The timing for fading options are different on each (probably because I'm using different USB chargers with different outputs) so it's hard to get two to switch colors at the same time.",

		"review": "This jet/plane is awesome easy to fly for the novice and fun to fly for the experience. If windy you need to take off horizontally in 3D then switch to 6g and it flies great. Vertical take off works perfectly and once you get the hang of it there is no need for auto landing. Jet can be very fast and smooth. I would recommend this to anyone that has basic experience in rc flying. When pairing follow the pairing instructions and repeat for a second time to make sure the gyro is perfect then the plane will be perfectly synchronized. Other than that have fun and happy flying!",

The spotlight is very bright and helps improve the video quality significantly at night. When the light comes on at night, you can see the colors very clearly. Quite outstanding!",

The light works well, it does not come with an outlet plug but I have plenty anyway. The remote does turn it on, off, different colors, how to change colors too. It can be placed horizontally or vertically. looks nice. Would have liked it to be music sensor too, that would have been a very nice plus. Regardless, looks nice. I have not tried the app, only the remote.",

My overall experience from purchase, scheduling and delivery exceeded my expectations.",
